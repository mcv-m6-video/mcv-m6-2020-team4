### Week4

* [x] Task 1.1: Optical Flow with Block Matching

![](https://github.com/mcv-m6-video/mcv-m6-2020-team4/blob/master/Results/Week4/task11.PNG)

* [x] Task 1.2: Off-the-shelf Optical Flow

* [x] Task 2.1: Video stabilization with Block Matching

* [x] Task 2.2: Off-the-shelf Stabilization

* [x] Task 3.1: Object Tracking with Optical Flow

We've tried two different approaches to include the Optical Flow to track.

The first one we tried to translate the detected bounding boxes using the optical flow.  

||Week 3 (Maximum Overlap) |Week 4 (Optical Flow)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|mAP|0.911|0.917|
|IDF1|0.788|0.604|

In the second approach we tried to restore the missed detections
  
||Maximum Overlap(improved)|Maximum Overlap (improved) +  Optical Flow|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|mAP|0.911|0.9291|
|IDF1|0.919|0.917|
